# i2c_master

## About

i2c_master is a simple Verilog module created to transmit/receive data via i2c protocol. The module created based on https://github.com/mitya1337/Simple_I2C repository but I made it usable for real world devices. Tested using Basys3 pmods and SSD1306 oled screen

## P.S.

Probably in the future I will make variable data length to receive/transmit
